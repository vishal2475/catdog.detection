Prepare Image Data:

Load training and validation images from their folders.

Resize all images to 100x100 pixels.

Rescale pixel values from 0–255 to 0–1 using ImageDataGenerator.

Load images in batches of 10 with binary class labels (dog or cat).

Build the CNN Model:

Use a Sequential model.

Add a Conv2D layer with 16 filters and ReLU activation to extract features.

Add a MaxPooling2D layer to downsample feature maps.

Flatten the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.

Add a fully connected Dense layer with 32 neurons and ReLU activation.

Add an output Dense layer with 1 neuron and sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Compile the Model:

Use the Adam optimizer.

Use binary cross-entropy as the loss function.

Track accuracy as the evaluation metric.

Train the Model:

Train the model on the training data for 5 epochs.

Validate the model on the validation data during training.

Save the Model:

Save the trained model to a file dog_cat_classifier_model.h5.

This allows reusing the model later without retraining.

Predict on New Images:

Define a function to load and preprocess a new image.

Resize the image to 100x100 pixels and normalize pixel values.

Predict the class using the trained model.

If prediction > 0.5, classify as Dog; otherwise, classify as Cat.

Print and return the predicted class.

Example Usage:

Call the prediction function with the path to a new image.

The function will output the predicted label (Dog or Cat).

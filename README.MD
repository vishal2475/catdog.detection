# Dog vs Cat Image Classifier using CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify images as **Dog** or **Cat**.

---

## 📁 Prepare Image Data

- Load training and validation images from their folders.
- Resize all images to **100x100** pixels.
- Rescale pixel values from **0–255** to **0–1** using `ImageDataGenerator`.
- Load images in batches of **10** with **binary class labels** (dog or cat).

---

## 🧠 Build the CNN Model

- Use a `Sequential` model.
- Add a `Conv2D` layer with **16 filters** and **ReLU** activation to extract features.
- Add a `MaxPooling2D` layer to downsample feature maps.
- Flatten the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
- Add a fully connected `Dense` layer with **32 neurons** and ReLU activation.
- Add an output `Dense` layer with **1 neuron** and **sigmoid** activation for binary classification.

## ⚙️ Compile the Model

- Use the **Adam** optimizer.
- Use **binary cross-entropy** as the loss function.
- Track **accuracy** as the evaluation metric.

---

## 🎯 Train the Model

- Train the model on the training data for **5 epochs**.
- Validate the model on the validation data during training.

## 💾 Save the Model

- Save the trained model to a file:
